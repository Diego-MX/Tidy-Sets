### Step 0. Set-up the workbench.
When running in `iteractive` mode, I've included some interaction with the user.  At first this was to get the working directory, but then I wanted to include a kind-of-funny greeting. 

The double question marks are intentional, for fun maybe.  

The different R spacing and indentation are an old habit.  I plan to change in the future.  Thanks for understanding. 

### Step 2 skips step 1.  Mean and Standard Deviation.
