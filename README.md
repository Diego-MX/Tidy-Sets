This is a class project from Coursera.  We are to download experiment data from a website and follow the guidelines.  In this document I include comments about the script `run_analysis.R`.  

The order which I've followed in the script corresponds to the requirements from the guidelines, and doesn't necessarily optimize computer resources. 

I use double question marks for questions, if any, and a compact style of coding for `R`.  I apologise in advance.

#### Step 0. Set-up the workbench
When running in `iteractive` mode, I've included interaction with the user to determine whether we're at the right directory.

#### Step 1.  Merge data
This is a straight up row binding from two datasets. 

#### Step 2.  Mean and Standard Deviation
Use `grep` function to find `'mean'` and `'std'` text in variables, and filter those out. 

#### Step 3.
